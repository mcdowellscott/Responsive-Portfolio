                        <p>My name is Scott McDowell.  I am a native of Colorado where I have lived for 49 years.  I grew up in Lakewood
                        and went to Bear Creek High School and later attended Colorado State University for college.  I majored in 
                        accounting and finance. </p>
                        <p>  I currently live in Castle Rock, Colorado.  I have a wife and four beautiful daughters.  I am the CFO for a 
                        Real Estate Investment Company called Continental Realty Advisors.</p>
                        <p> Growing up I watched the Denver Broncos every Sunday and my hero was John Elway.</p>
